___

## Executive Summary

The market aim is to siphon customers of popular personal storage services (Google One, Apple iCloud, Dropbox, etc) that really just want to park their data somewhere in the cloud and never look at it again until they really need to.

The business model is a subscription model that is **never tiered** and sets a storage limit that accurately divdes personal storage use from enterprise needs. The subscription fee will have to be a bare minimum margin on infrastructure costs to compete. Money can be made if the majority of customers only use well below the average expected storage that served as an input for the subscription price.
